# 3D Graphics Engine  
A cool way to render hexagonal prisms and cylinders.
## Features  
- Different rendering modes
  - Wireframe
  - Polygon Filling with wireframe
  - Polygon Filling
  - Flat Shading
  - Gourad Shading
  - Phong Shading
 - A hexagonal prism or cylinder, depending on the rendering mode.
 - The ability to translate, rotate, and scale it.
 
 ## How to use  
Keyboard buttons 1-6 switch to the different rendering modes.  
Buttons on the bottom of the screen detail how to manipulate the object.  
It takes a bit for the 4th, 5th, and 6th rendering modes to compute, as I have not implemented multithreading (maybe I will in the future).
